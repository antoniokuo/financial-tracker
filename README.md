# Financial Tracker (CLI)

A simple Python command-line application to track personal expenses, calculate wages based on hours worked, and handle multiple currencies.

This project is designed as a personal financial tracker (v1) and structured to be extendable with additional features (e.g. bill splitting) in the future.

## Features (v1)
- Add and view personal expenses
- Calculate wages from hours worked
- Handle multiple currencies
- Save and load data locally

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Status
Version 1 — personal use.

## Roadmap

This project is being developed incrementally as a learning exercise alongside my MSc Computer Science.

Planned improvements:
- Refactor duplicated logic (expenses and wages totals)
- Improve input validation and error handling
- Add basic unit tests
- Prepare for a v2 with additional features (e.g. bill splitting)
